# Python-Code-Illustration-for-TrailStone
### This repository is used for applying the internship at TrailStone.

There are two folders in this repository.

1. Empirical Methods: This contains the assignments for the course Empirical Methods in Finance that was taught in the Berkeley MFE program during the 1st term. The assignments were done in Jupyter Notebook. Given that it is not a cooperative development environment, docstrings and comments were not included in the files. The code here is mainly used for illustrating Python language usage.
2. Backtesting_Platform: This contains the part of module I developed during my internship where I mainly worked on developing a Python-based backtesting framework. The code here is OOP-based. Docstrings and comments are included because it's a team-based project. However, I have to apologize that docstrings and comments were written in Chinese. Due to confidential issues, only part of non-core modules can be shown here.
